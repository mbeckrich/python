# import os
# import shutil

# Provide location to be removed, can use os.getcwd() first to ensure location is right
# os.unlink()

# os.rmdir can also be used to delete, but folder must be completely empty
# This makes it a nice safeguard
# os.rmdir()

# shutil has an rmtree() function that will remove folder and content

# These are permanent deletions, do not go to the recycle bin
