print("Hello")  # this prints `Hello`, vs typing "Hello" in terminal python,
# which would return `"Hello"`

# print("X") doesn't return the string, it actually returns special valuable called `None
# `, which represents the value of a lack of a value

# `None` in python shell returns nothing

spam = print()  # returns empty line
spam == None  # in python shell, returns True after spam is made variable for None

# If function doesn't have a return statement, value defaults to None
