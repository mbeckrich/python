# Form of a table
# Left-hand side is Key
# Right-hand side is Value
# Similar to book dictionary,
# Bug: An error in a program that prevents the program
# from running as expected.
# {Key: Value}
# {"Bug": "An error in a program that prevents the program
# from running as expected."}

# Use comma to separate key: value pairs.

# If dictionary has more than one element, open curly at top,
# every subsequent entry is indented once. Last curly goes on its own line
# add comma at end of every pair.
# x = {
# }

# print(x["Key"]) will print value.
# add new items to dict by:
# x["Loop"] = "value"

# Can help to start with an empty dict, x = {}
# then add using x["Loop"] = "Value"

# Can wipe dictionary by reseting with x = {} after
# pairs are entered

# Values can be redefined same way you would add new pairs

# A for loop will print only keys, e.g.
# for key in x:
#   print(key)
# will return the keys of x dictionary
# Would use print(x[key]) to get a value
